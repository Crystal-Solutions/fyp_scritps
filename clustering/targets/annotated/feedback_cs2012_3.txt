Lecture series 	854	Lecture series was good . 
handling UI components 	938	It would have been much better if we were taught about handling UI components . Rather than focusing on object oriented principles , we have to pay much more attention to learn to deal with UI .

tutorials 	1099	I suggest if some tutorials regarding each lecture is provided , It would very helpful for us . 
worked examples 	1293	It is better if we can have more worked examples and tutorials . 
tutorials 	1313	It is better if we can have more worked examples and tutorials . 
your efforts on teaching 	1482	I started this module as a student who has no idea about OOP but Ma'am thanks to you now I have some idea on the subject . While I 'm really appreciating your efforts on teaching I have to tell the concurrency part which is covered by the other lecturer was not up to the standard you maintained : ) .

lectures 	1657	It would be better if the lectures were conducted using more practical side . 
project 	1939	Though most of the students are kinds of experts in java , I 'm just a beginner . But I have learned the language quicker than I thought . There are pros and cons regarding the semester project . Thanks to the project I was motivated to learn Java quickly as well as in a well ordered manner ( unlike python , I used to learn concepts in coding ) . But meanwhile since it 's my first ( considerably long ) code in java I know that I have made some errors and I 've corrected them as much as I can ( not all of them ) , knowing that I won 't be doing the same error in my next program . Apart from coding , everything else was just perfect ! . Thanks : ) .

GUI building 	2693	It 's good we could have more learning on GUI building . 
demonstrations , 	2745	It will be easy to understand the demonstrations , if you can write the example code at the movement . Then we will have enough time to get the idea of the code other than just take the code on the hard and explain it and run it . Thanks .

swimming competition 	3074	would be better to develop something more realistic and exciting than a swimming competition . 
databases 	3138	More details should be included about databases . 
Reasons for using OOP concepts 	3153	Reasons for using OOP concepts was not clear at first . Therefore it was difficult to grab the right idea about them .

Letters 	3999	- Letters were small and sometimes marker pens had less ink .- I love architecture practical series because it tested if we had studied the lectures every week . I don 't always study . In almost every lab , I was able to go through the lecture note and complete the lab successfully . That practical series made us sure that we would not miss any lecture . OOP practical sessions has no use other than wasting time without a proper day end objective . I think it was my main reason ( or at least my main not - motivation ) to become imperfect in OOP module .- Keep on the java course at the beginning .- Less examples in UML class diagrams . Some websites confused some definitions . Do some in - class UML class diagram .

Semester project 	4725	Semester project was not easy to implement because at first I had no idea what was asking here . It would have been better if that was something we had experienced before to code . 
starting lectures 	4944	it will be much appreciate if the starting lectures goes little slower and detailed since majority of the students have no idea about oop . It was difficult to pick it up and also drag us behind in other subjects too . We must appreciate the effort taken by helping lecturer , since she did as good as possible to explain us the concepts . But if all the lectures are conducted by Mrs. Lecturer _ x , it will be much appreciated . thank you . : ) .

example codes 	5390	It is better if you upload example codes showed in class along with the lecture slides to the moodle . 
spot tests 	5476	having spot tests at the end of the lecture was a good way of seeing whether we learnt the concepts . 
MVC architecture 	5586	Things like MVC architecture could be taught before starting GUI implementation of programs . 
adding a database to our semester project 	5702	When trying to fulfill task of adding a database to our semester project I am feeling clueless . If some knowledge about databases is given it is worth a lot .

lecture series 	5849	We had a good lecture series which intended us that there is more than programming in this CS field . Both lecturers taught well . Giving a quiz at the end seems unfair since it is hard to learn the concepts just by a lecture before any practical usage .

OOP 	6095	OOP is undoubtedly the most important module and we started our semester project ( Swimming Competition ) with a great joy with the intention to do a great creation by the semester end . But complex topics like Concurrency come , lectures went really really fast and the most of us could not grab much from the lecture . We noticed that the lecturer is trying to cover all the slides within the day and to explain the topics for us only if time permits . But that attempt was not so successful . Lecturers did their best , we know ! . But time allocated for the subject is not enough ; or there must be something wrong in somewhere - else . We understood this subject only at the last week of the semester . But when we get the big picture , we were late ! . For the project , we could not apply things we learned during last 2 weeks , so how can it measure our true learning ? . It was a so tight schedule ! . At the end of the semester , all the lectures are only concentrating on covering the slides and to finish getting the continuous assessment marks of ours . We came to CSE with the trust you made in us through the first semester well- structured lecture series . But now we see this as a race ; not a true teaching - learning process . Honor Code pledges were taken at the beginning to make sure that we learn everything by our own self . We thought we came to heaven like department where the lecturers help us to grow and we thought we are gonna be one big family . But now we know it is just marketing . We love learning these subjects ; the truth is these are not hard for us . But please give students some time to go to the depth and do things with a better - understanding ! . Covering the module and doing the CA evaluations can be done after students learn the subject properly . If our department continues this way for future , you would one day make a stack - overflow generation ; not a skilled and creative workforce ! . My request is to give students the freedom to learn concepts and do things creatively , then they will master in the subject . Isn 't it the ultimate purpose of both parties ? . Please give us support to learn things properly first , we really want to learn , we have that passion for the subject ! . Please make that environment at CSE ! . Thank you very much madam for everything you taught us throughout the semester ! . We know you did a great job for us , although the module was so lengthy for this semester ! . Hope our feedback would help the administration to make a better CSE Dept tomorrow ! .

Please give us support to learn things properly first , we really want to learn , we have that passion for the subject ! . Please make that environment at CSE ! .

time allocated for the subject 	6634	OOP is undoubtedly the most important module and we started our semester project ( Swimming Competition ) with a great joy with the intention to do a great creation by the semester end . But complex topics like Concurrency come , lectures went really really fast and the most of us could not grab much from the lecture . We noticed that the lecturer is trying to cover all the slides within the day and to explain the topics for us only if time permits . But that attempt was not so successful . Lecturers did their best , we know ! . But time allocated for the subject is not enough ; or there must be something wrong in somewhere - else . We understood this subject only at the last week of the semester . But when we get the big picture , we were late ! . For the project , we could not apply things we learned during last 2 weeks , so how can it measure our true learning ? . It was a so tight schedule ! . At the end of the semester , all the lectures are only concentrating on covering the slides and to finish getting the continuous assessment marks of ours . We came to CSE with the trust you made in us through the first semester well- structured lecture series . But now we see this as a race ; not a true teaching - learning process . Honor Code pledges were taken at the beginning to make sure that we learn everything by our own self .

project 	8951	It would be better to have multiple lab tasks related OOP than giving a whole project once . It would be helpful to improve coding abilities and styles . Rather than suggesting sequences of methods , you could let the student do a project as they wish .
