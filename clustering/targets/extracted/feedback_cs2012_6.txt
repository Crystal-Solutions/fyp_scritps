session 	192	It was a good session and really appreciated it . Since OOP is something new to me , I was much benefited from it and could grasp some tips . Better if we can have the rest of the lecture on another day . Please schedule the remaining session to the latter part of the semester because we can gain some knowledge from our module and that knowledge could be revised from this lecture .
