Workshop has been conducted well. But we haven't given proper instructions to install required applications for windows. Therefore I have spent whole the time with downloading things. Except that everything was perfect.
kindly request that not to force the students to install Linux instead of windows since it works fine in windows. It worked on my windows laptop which windows 10 is running. This is just an acknowledgment.
Good workshop and very useful content!. But it is really better if we could prepare more and spend more time for this workshop. Things went really fast and we couldn't grab some points. Anyway please extend our thanks to everyone involved!
This session was interesting and well structured
Workshop is really good and we learn a lot. But the allocated time for this workshop should be extended because at the end of workshop things go really fast and it is difficult to catch up.
Good
