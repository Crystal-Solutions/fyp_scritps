Good The session was very useful and interesting Good workshop! We worked on Windows and got some bugs while configuring, but we could resolve them with few clicks and it was not so hard as mentioned in the instructions. It is better if we could have more time with the workshop and practice more. Please extend our thanks for everyone! A good workshop. Good. Keep it up The session is very interesting and useful to get understand about QT. And it was very good to have an in class assignment and it motivated us Workshop was interesting and UI making part was really helpful as we can use it to design our current working project's GUIs. Giving a chance to make an UI in the workshop is challenging and good to understand what we just learned. Got to knew Qt creator. Will be very useful in future. Thanks Company_z team.
